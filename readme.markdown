# (BDScript)

## A fully functional and customizable Discord bot, now open-sourced!

I created CRBT back in mid-2019 in BDScript as just a fun project to start getting into bot development and code.
Nowadays, CRBT has a lot of commands and is used by many to get infos, change their profiles, earn some goodies, and develop their servers!

## How to import the commands?

Firstly, this code is restricted to [Bot Designer For Discord](https://botdesignerdiscord.com) (BDFD), which means you can't use it elsewhere.
Now that's out of the way, let's see how to import these commands into BDFD:

1. [Open the `commands` folder](https://github.com/Clembs/CRBT-BDScript/tree/main/commands)
2. Open whatever command you'd want to import
3. Copy its code
4. [Open Bot Designer For Discord](https://botdesignerdiscord.com/app/home) and go into your bot's commands section
5. Create a new command
6. Paste the code
7. Set the language to BDScript Unstable if the original command file extension is `.bdscriptunstable`
8. Hit "SAVE COMMAND" and try it out!

## How to import the variables?

1. [Open the `variables.bdfdvars` file](https://github.com/Clembs/CRBT-BDScript/blob/main/variables.bdfdvars)
2. [Open Bot Designer For Discord](https://botdesignerdiscord.com/app/home) and go into your bot's variables section
3. Add a variable
4. In BDFD, the variable name should match the "name" tag in the repo's variables file, and same thing for the value
5. Hit "SAVE VARIABLE"
